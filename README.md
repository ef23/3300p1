**A static visualization of Trump's Twitter**

Members: Erin Chen, Eric Feng, Catherine (Sohyeon) Hwang

This is the first project for Cornell's [CS/INFO3300](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info3300/). The data for this project was pulled from [Trump Twitter Archive](https://trumptwitterarchive.com), from the first day of his campaign (June 15, 2015), until February 1, 2018.

This project primarily used D3.js to generate the data visualizations.
