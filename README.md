This is the first project for Cornell's [CS/INFO3300](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info3300/). The data for this project was pulled from [Trump Twitter Archive](https://trumptwitterarchive.com), from the first day of his presidency (January 20, 2017), until the day the data was pulled (February 25, 2018).
